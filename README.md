This snakegame is the similar snakegame in the old NOKIA PHONES 
The game does not have any complicated cofigurations but there are documentation to the turtle documentation

documentation = https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

but also you found this on my github so feel free to customize the game as you like 
but "if it works dont refactor the Architecture behind the game" but you can change the color or shape of the snake etc just like in the specified documentation

Thanks!!!
